I have a program that can synthesize a wave file from a csv file. It takes data in this format: <note><octave>, <start time>, <duration>
Start time and duration are as read as floats, note is a pitch class from the chromatic scale, and the octave is an integer.

Here is an example of the C major chord played for 1 second:
C4, 0, 1
E4, 0, 1
G4, 0, 1
B4, 0, 1
D5, 0, 1
F5, 0, 1
A5, 0, 1

Help me compose some music!
